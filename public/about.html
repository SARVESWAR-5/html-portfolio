<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is S.Sarveswar. I am currently studying computer science engineering at most prestigious university in
  Tamilnadu "ANNA UNIVERSITY. I completed my first year and stepping up into my second year. The college life was 
  completely different from school and took lot of time to get adapted to it. I got introduced to many people
  and lot of friends in the college. I started to understand the basics of computer science and currently working 
  to improve my skills.

<p>I learned C programming at the begining. This helped me to understand the basics of programming. I started to solve
  many problems to improve my problem solving skills. I started to do problems from leet code and hacker rank. These 
  websites have variety of problems to work on. Then i started to learn C++. I personally like C++ very much that C. 
  C++ is a object oriented language. This have many advantages comparing C languge.

<p>Now i am currently stdying the concepts of DSA- data structures and algorithms. This is the base of problem solving.
  Various problems with different types can be asked from these concepts. I started to study from basics. I covered 
  patters, recursion , arrays and currently i am in linked list and hoping to conver the rest as soon as possible. 
  I am using a website and a youtube channel called STRIVER TUF which is very helpful to learn DSA in c++ language.
  STRIVER TUF A2Z sheet holds all the concepts from basic to advance. At the same time i started to learn web development 
  which is the base which every programmer must learn. I am leaning this from UDEMY under the course instructor Angela.
  My goal is to master these topics in this year and start to learn JAVA programming along with it. 

  The concepts need to be covered and practise is vast but with concept motivation and support i think i could achive this.
  I am well motivated and  concentrating to complete my tasks everyday constantly.
